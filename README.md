# FriendFinder

We are calling this a friend finder, but it's really like a dating app.

Basically you answer some questions, and then the app finds the best match based on other users in the system.

The app uses [express for Node.js](https://expressjs.com/) and it's hosted on heroku here:

Thanks very much to whomever built [this version of the app](https://friend-finder.herokuapp.com/)-- as I re-used their front-end!

Also, much of the server code is 'inspired' by the back-end for the [hot-restauarant app](https://hot-restaurant.herokuapp.com/), which I can't share, as it's within the UC Berkeley's bootcamp's repo.

I learned some important life and coding lessons this week.

My week was very crazy at work and at home-- way above average crazy. So it meant writing coding in stressful situations with my mind on other things.

I was able to roll easily through the scaffolding of the site, through the front-end, etc. But then when I had to code the actual logic that would find the best match, I found it difficult to focus with all the crazy around me.

Finally, I woke up at 4 AM, with that buzzing feeling, sat down with coffee and water, and worked my way through the logic. And I figured it out. It was the most amazing feeling. To know I can still solve trickier problems in the midst of crazy life.

I've had multiple discussions with engineers about the balance between coding and outside interests. And based on these discussions, I worried that I might not be able to learn to code, as I'm a mom, and I have a job, and those 'distractions' might not allow me to properly focus.

This week I felt this reality, but I also managed to figure it out, by finally getting a quiet space and powering through it. I suspect I learned a lot in my failed attempts too. The solution will stick with me.

I also wanted to add one last thing-- I would like to refactor a bit, add better comments, etc., but I'm seriously running out of time. Family is arriving-- and once they are here, I just won't be able to do anymore.

So note that I would have made the code all the better, if there was just a little less going on!

Thanks for your understanding,

Meggin
