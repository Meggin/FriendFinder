# FriendFinder

We are calling this a friend finder, but it's really like a dating app.

Basically you answer some questions, and then the app finds the best match based on other users in the system.

The app uses [express for Node.js](https://expressjs.com/) and it's hosted on heroku here:

Thanks very much to whomever built [this version of the app](https://friend-finder.herokuapp.com/)-- as I re-used their front-end!

Also, much of the server code is 'inspired' by the back-end for the [hot-restauarant app](https://hot-restaurant.herokuapp.com/), which I can't share, as it's within the UC Berkeley's bootcamp's repo.

I learned some important life and coding lessons this week.

My week was very crazy at work and at home-- way above average crazy. So it meant writing coding in stressful situations with my mind on other things.

I was able to roll easily through the scaffolding of the site, through the front-end, etc. But then when I had to code the actual logic that would find the best match, I found it difficult to focus with all the crazy around me.

Finally, I woke up at 4 AM, with that buzzing feeling, sat down with coffee and water, and worked my way through the logic. And I figured it out. It was the most amazing feeling. To know I can still solve trickier problems in the midst of crazy life.

I've been told by several engineers around me that they truly don't believe that people can truly write code, if they have too many other things to focus on (like families, etc.)

I respect that difficulty-- I really do. But it is possible to make the time, if you truly love the game of it.

I also wanted to add one last thing-- I would like to refactor a bit, add better comments, etc., but I'm seriously running out of time. Family is arriving-- and once they are here, I just won't be able to do anymore.

So note that I would have made the code all the better, if there was just a little less going on!

Thanks for your understanding,

Meggin
